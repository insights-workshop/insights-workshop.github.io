15:00 Invited Talk 2. Sasha Luccioni - Reproducibility in ML and the Environment: What's the Connection?

Abstract: In the last 5 years, since the advent of BERT Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in the current AI research landscape, as well as increasingly deployed in user-facing products in contexts ranging from health to education. However, many characteristics of LLMs - their inherent lack of reproducibility, the steep compute cost of their training, and the lack of openness in terms of access â€“ are having wide-ranging repercussions. In this talk, I will talk about recent progress in AI and how this is changing the field of AI in terms of scientific rigor and open science. I will also propose concrete steps that can be taken to ensure that AI research and practice stays reproducible, sustainable and ethical.

Bio: Dr. Sasha Luccioni is a leading scientist at the nexus of artificial intelligence, ethics, and sustainability, with a PhD in AI and a decade of research and industry expertise. She is the Climate Lead at Hugging Face, a global startup in responsible open-source AI, where she spearheads research, consulting and capacity-building to elevate the sustainability of AI systems. A founding member of Climate Change AI (CCAI) and a board member of Women in Machine Learning (WiML), Sasha is passionate about catalyzing impactful change, organizing events and serving as a mentor to under-represented minorities within the AI community.
