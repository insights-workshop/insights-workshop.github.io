## <span style="color:#267CB9">Project goals</span>

Publication of negative results is difficult in most fields, but in NLP the problem is exacerbated by the near-universal focus on improvements in benchmarks. This situation implicitly discourages hypothesis-driven research, and it turns creation and fine-tuning of NLP models into art rather than science. Furthermore, it increases the time, effort, and carbon emissions spent on developing and tuning models, as the researchers have no opportunity to learn what has already been tried and failed.

This workshop invites both practical and theoretical unexpected or negative results that have important implications for future research, highlight methodological issues with existing approaches, and/or point out pervasive misunderstandings or bad practices. Please note that narrow, task-specific negative results (e.g. "tweaking parameter X for model Y did not work for dataset Z") would not suffice. You need to show why X could be expected to work for Y (e.g. based on the previously reported results), you need to show that it doesn't (preferably on several datasets), and you need to suggest why this could be the case.

A successful negative results paper would contribute one of the following:

* ablation studies of components in previously proposed models, showing that their contributions are different from the initially reported;
* datasets or probing tasks  showing that previous approaches do not generalize to other domains or language phenomena;
* cross-lingual studies showing that a technique X is only successful for a certain language or language family;
experiments on (in)stability of the previously published results due to hardware, random initializations, etc.;
* broadly applicable recommendations for training/fine-tuning, especially if X that didn't work is something that many practitioners would think reasonable to try, and if the demonstration of X's failure is accompanied by some explanation/hypothesis.

The workshop will accept short papers as well as non-archival abstract submissions for papers published elsewhere (e.g. in one of the main conferences or in non-NLP venues), with the aim of bringing together relevant negative results.

In the interest of recognizing the work that did not lead to leaderboard breakthroughs but still yielded useful insights, there will be an award for the best negative results paper.
