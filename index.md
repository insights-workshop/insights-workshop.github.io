# Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in NLP

Publication of negative results is difficult in most fields, but in NLP the problem is exacerbated by the near-universal focus on improvements in benchmarks. This situation implicitly discourages hypothesis-driven research, and it turns creation and fine-tuning of NLP models into art rather than science. Furthermore, it increases the time, effort, and carbon emissions spent on developing and tuning models, as the researchers have no opportunity to learn what has already been tried and failed.

This workshop invites both practical and theoretical unexpected or negative results that have important implications for future research, highlight methodological issues with existing approaches, and/or point out pervasive misunderstandings or bad practices. Please note that narrow, task-specific negative results (e.g. "tweaking parameter X for model Y did not work for dataset Z") would not suffice. You need to show why X could be expected to work for Y (e.g. based on the previously reported results), you need to show that it doesn't (preferably on several datasets), and you need to suggest why this could be the case.
